# Reimbursement client app

This project requires the use of `pnpm` as the package manager. Please do not use `npm` or `yarn`.

When adding new dependencies, please consult with the project owner to ensure that they are necessary and do not introduce unnecessary bloat.

Please avoid using `any` type as much as possible. Instead, use specific types or interfaces to ensure type safety and maintainability.

When submitting pull requests, please send them to the `development` branch instead of directly to the `main` branch.

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```
